# Ionic app to demonstrate automated tests #

This repository contains an Ionic app which uses Angular and Capacitor. 
The app's purpose is it to demonstrate how to write automatic tests for Ionic apps.

The app allows to query for IATA codes (International Air Transport Association), namely [airport codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA_airport_code)
and [airline codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline_codes), but only a few airports and airlines are actually "stored" (i.e. hard-coded) in the app, 
see [class IatadbService](src/app/iatadb.service.ts).

The author of this app is not related to the IATA in any way.
